      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Ping Pong Club is a non-profit organization based in Concord, MA which raises money for Mass General Hospital and Dana Farber in community ping pong tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the Chief Technology Officer, I led the development of the organization website from scratch. The project was started from nothing: a small team of myself and another programmer, both having to learn web design from nothing; no previous website or design; and very little direction from a still young club.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
