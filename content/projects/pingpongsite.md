The Ping Pong Club is a non-profit organization based in Concord, MA which raises money for Mass General Hospital and Dana Farber in community ping pong tournaments.

As the Chief Technology Officer, I led the development of the organization website from scratch. The project was started from nothing: a small team of myself and another programmer, both having to learn web design from nothing; no previous website or design; and very little direction from a still young club. 

Our online presence provides information about upcoming events, past achievements, and an online store used to sell merchandise.

The project used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator, and the Hugo theme [Tella](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/tella/). The website also required editing of the HTML templates used by the theme to meet the specific needs we had as a non-profit.

[Square](https://squareup.com) is used for the online store, although it is seperate from the main website and served from a different subdomain.
