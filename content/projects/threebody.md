This was made for the front page of this website, which you can see by clicking the weevil in the top left.

The three body problem involves three bodies with mass that apply gravitational forces to each other. The simulation on the home page is a simplified version, where gravity is greatly increased and forces are dampened to prevent the bodies from flying off into empty space too often.
