This is an implementation of the peHash algorithm according to ["peHash: A Novel Approach to Fast Malware Clustering"](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/leet09/tech/full_papers/wicherski/wicherski.pdf) as part of an exploration of similarity digest generation for Portable Executable files.

It is implemented in C and relies on the `libbz2` and `openssl` libraries.
